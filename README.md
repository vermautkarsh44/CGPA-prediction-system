CGPA Prediction System

Studentsâ€™ academic performance is a very concerned issue as it is the reflection of both academic background and family support. It is very important for the educational institution to track the performance record because it can help them to improve the quality of their education.
Thus, the role of early CGPA prediction system comes into place. A CGPA Prediction system, this project seeks to create a model that can predict the CGPA of students based on some certain features. The main aim of this project is the prediction of the result in the form of CGPA of students for any subject considering schooling marks, continuous assessment and final marks during their academic semester using different Machine Learning models. 

Contents of the project include:
1. Collection of dataset
2. Data pre-processing
3. Applying machine learning models
  a. Multiple Linear Regression
  b. Random Forest Regression
  c. Naive Bayes' Classifier
  d. Random Forest Classification
  e. Decision Tree Classification
  f. Logistic Regression Classification
5. Graph plots
6. Calculating accuracy
